# Ribo-Seq-analysis

Run notebook Riboseq.ipynb

Due to problems with installing DESeq2 in a Python notebook, I performed the part with differential expression analysis in R. To start the "Differential expression analysis" notebook, you need a file 'design.tsv' and '01. RiboSeq_RNA Seq_HC_counts.tsv'.

The obtained analysis data was then processed in Python using the files 'raw_diseq.tsv', 'rpf_deseq.tsv', and 'total_deseq.tsv'
